## WAD PROJECT INITIATE: Playful Cybersecurity Consultancy Website 

This is a website I built to explore cybersecurity services in a fun and informative way. It's designed to be user-friendly and raise awareness about protecting your data. Think of it as a playground to learn about cybersecurity consultants!
